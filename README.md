# Book-Library

This project was to reinforce good practices in react. It is a book search engine, which I have saved inside a mock, where I simulate a fetch by making it async. I implement an end-to-end test where I test each part of the project as if it were a client, from adding, searching, and deleting the books, which I manage through states.
